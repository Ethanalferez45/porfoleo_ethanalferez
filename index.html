  <h2>Unit 1: HTML</h2>
  <!--add reflection answer-->

    <li>Reflection Questions:
      <ol>
          <ul>

        <li>What do you think are the most important vocabulary terms (or key concepts)
          in this unit? What do you think that they mean?</li>
          <p>!DOCTYPE HTML, head and your body are the most important vocabulary terms because the DOCTYPE is the one that starts off
            the whole website such as the body and speaking of body, body is where you add other terms.</p>

            <li>What do you think the most important skills that you learned in this unit of study?</li>
            <p>What I think that I have learned are how to add links, change the font, font-size, font-color and background-color.</p>

            <li>In what ways have you gotten better at this kind of work?</li>
            <p>I think I've gotten better with adding the links and heading and lists and all of that, but since it is a lot of work
                that were taking, I might forget parts of it but if I review I'll remember it again.</p>

              <li>In what ways do you think you need to improve?</li>
              <p>I think I might need to improve with the Unorder lists, the Order lists and a href.</p>

              <li>What problems did you encounter while you were working on this piece? How did you solve them?</li>
              <p>One of the problems that I encountered were adding images, when I chose the image I would add the image address
                so I would ask my classmates for help or the instructor.</p>

                <li>What was especially satisfying to you about either the process or the finished product?</li>
                <p>What was very satisfying to me was finishing the hard part, having to get the hard part over and not dealing with
                  it much.</p>

                  <li>If you were the teacher, what comments would you make about this piece?</li>
                  <p>If I were to be the teacher and I see this piece I would probably say that you can do better(In this case me)
                    and to ask me(or the teacher)for help or to guide you through the troubles you have and will come.</p>
                </ul>
